Maquillage is a plugin that lets you add tags and name colors that players can select through a GUI. You can add tags and name colors either through in-game commands or by importing them (see below).

Maquillage also supports nicknames, either through Maquillage itself, but it also has placeholders that support [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/) nicknames.

To have Maquillage cosmetics appear in chat, you need a chat plugin that supports MiniMessage. Examples of this include [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/) and [SunLight](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sunlight-%E2%AD%90-best-z-essentials-cmi-alternative.67733/). For Maquillage cosmetics in the tab-menu you need a tab-plugin that support MiniMessage, and an example of that is [TAB](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tab-1-5-1-21-1.57806/).

### Multi-server support
Maquillage can be run on multiple servers and will keep data up-to-date between them. To run on multiple servers, you need to use the same remote database for all servers. Any changes you make on one server will then be implemented on the other servers.

### Modules
Maquillage is entirely modular, and disabling any modules will not affect your ability to use the other modules.

### PlaceholderAPI
Maquillage uses PlaceholderAPI (PAPI) to provide parseable strings. These are the available placeholders:
```
%maquillage_namecolor% - The player's selected namecolor, followed by their username.
%maquillage_namecolor_nickname% - The player's selected namecolor, followed by their Maquillage nickname.
%maquillage_namecolor_essentialsnick% - The player's selected namecolor, followed by their EssentialsX nickname.
%maquillage_tag% - The player's selected tag, with a trailing white space.
%maquillage_tag_nospace% - The player's selected tag without a trailing white space.
```

### Stable Releases

Stable releases can be downloaded from the platforms linked above.

### Pre-Releases

Pre-releases/release-candidates are denoted by having `RC` in the name. These releases are made ahead of stable releases and should not be considered entirely stable.

### Experimental Builds

Experimental builds/snapshots are denoted by having `SNAPSHOT` in the name and should be considered unstable. These are bleeding edge builds produced from the latest available code. We do not recommend running these in production environments as these builds are unfinished and may contain serious issues.
